# Lab1-HTML-CSS
This time, you're going to recreate a world-famous platform for renting accommodations as a mock project. The goal is to demonstrate that you can build a visually appealing web page using just HTML and CSS, even if it won't have functional backend features yet.

Weâ€™ve already provided the HTML structure and all the images you'll need for this project. Take a look at the reference page youâ€™ll be cloning for inspiration.

No time to wasteâ€”let's get started! With the power of CSS, weâ€™ll make our starter code look amazing.

Key Goals:
Make it Responsive
Your page should look great on any screen size. Start with mobile-first design, ensuring the layout works perfectly on small screens. Then, use media queries to adapt the layout for larger screens like tablets and desktops.

Clone the Design Accurately
Match the reference page as closely as possible in terms of appearance. Pay attention to details like fonts, spacing, and colors.

Remember:
Simplicity is keyâ€”focus on clean, organized CSS.
Test your design at various screen sizes to ensure a seamless user experience.
Let's dive in and create something amazing! ðŸŽ‰
